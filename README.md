Welcome to the **LeetCode Top 150 Solutions** repository! This repo contains my implementations of the top 150 LeetCode interview questions, providing solutions in both **Java** and **Python**.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
LeetCode-Top-150-Solutions/
├── [Problem_Title_1]/
│   ├── java/
│   │   ├── solution.java
│   │   └── documentation.txt
│   └── python/
│       ├── solution.py
│       └── documentation.txt
│
├── [Problem_Title_2]/
│   ├── java/
│   │   ├── solution.java
│   │   └── documentation.txt
│   └── python/

```


- Each problem is in its own folder named after the problem title.
- Inside each problem folder, there are two subfolders:
  - `java`: Contains the Java solution and a documentation file with detailed explanations.
  - `python`: Contains the Python solution and a documentation file with detailed explanations.

## Features

- **Dual Language Support**: Solutions available in both Java and Python.
- **In-Depth Documentation**: Each problem folder includes a `documentation.txt` file that outlines:
  - Problem description
  - Approach and algorithm
  - Complexity analysis
- **Well-Commented Code**: Each solution is annotated with comments to help you understand the logic and flow.
